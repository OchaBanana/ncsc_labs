Due to Covid-19 **Remote Installations** are now being done with the majority of our customers. This can be done in a few ways. The remote installation workflow is different but can be simplified by manually setting the node IPs. Because manually setting the node IPs covers a much broader situations we will be focusing on these steps in the Labs. Rack and stack and **setting the IPMI IPs via BIOS or ipmitool command** will have to be done by someone ahead of time in order for you to have access to these systems remotely.

.. note::

The remote installation steps are also used for node models that do not have 1Gb ports or dark sites.
